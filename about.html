  First off thank you for taking time to view this and my resume website in
  general!

    <h3>Generally</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I like to focus on my work when on the job and give what I have to
        complete tasks. I learned this from playing sports my whole life where
        in game and even in practice there isn't a whole bunch of just having
        conversations, it's more talking about what you're trying to accomplish,
        goal minded communication is what took place.

    <li>
      When not trying to be so goal oriented I like to play video games for fun,
      learn coding, make databases, watch anime, Disney movies, South Park, keep
      up with fantasy football and watch NBA games, right now my favorite teams
      and the Hornets and the Warriors (see if you can guess why).
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><h3>Summary</h3></li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      I'm pretty simple, I try to find time for friends and family even though
      there is always time when they need something I'm usually finding ways to
      kick it with myself until I can find the money to start going out
      frequently. As right now I am living below my means to secure my livlihood
      and place of living.

  well rounded and willing to do the work no one else will because that is how
  I'm wired, I'm also wired to strive and be the best around. I look forward
  to hearing from you and enjoy your day and the rest of my resume website!</h4>
