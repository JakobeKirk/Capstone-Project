<h2>Kirk Self Care LLC</h2>
<p>
  I founded Kirk Self Care to inspire change in the world. This change is for
  people who are kind, selfless and giving to provide some of that effort to
  themselves. My belief is that good self care will create more balance to the
  world and inspire creativity. Kirk Self Care focuses on the individual and
  their happiness and aspirations, in an attempt to eliminate the copy cat
  syndrome. We want to pull your best self out and nurture it to keep you and
  your best self inspired with love and care.

      Lots of communication with helpful resources, be it; suppliers of product,
      customer feedback, and website chats for any questions or concerns I have
      about the website I'm using i.e. Shopify. I consider everyone listed as a
      part of my team and touch base with these departments whenever necessary.

          Also communication and research into understanding the law behind
          business practices has been a lot of work. I've taken Udemy courses
          and went to banks for advise, along with communicating to Secretary of
          State.

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
  Overall, learning how to be my own boss while maintaining a job and a living
  has been a struggle for me. However over these last 3 years I have been able
  to master the balance needed to sustain the both while keeping myself happy
  with my hobbies and what not.
</p>
<p>
  The main takeaway is this: I'm looking for a job that can use my skillset and
  in turn, pay me enough to pay my bills while being able to fund my business
  and for me that pay or salary is around $20 per hour or $40,000 a year.
