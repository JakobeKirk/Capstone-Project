    <li>
      I could speak to everyday people in person and have normal conversations
      while trying to promote well know non profit charities such as Wounded
      Warriors Project and ASPCA.

    <li>
      While traffic was slow I was able to build comradery with my coworkers as
      we awaited more customers to pitch to
    </li>
    <li>
      I got paid $300 a week no matter what and at minimum added $20 to my check
      per donation earned toward these non profits. I won our donation prize for
      multiple weeks as I stayed motivated and educated to do my best.
